# CAPS - Cursor Agent Project Starter

This open-source app provides a local UI for developers to generate and manage starter kits for their Cursor projects.

A starter kit includes technical documentation (as markdown files), Cursor-compatible rules, and a checklist of tasks for the Cursor agent.
The goal is to enable developers to go from project idea to implementation with clearly defined specs, agent rules, and actionable tasksâ€”all structured for AI-assisted development inside Cursor.

## Features

*   Simple web UI to describe your project.
*   Define project details (description, problem, features, target users).
*   Specify your intended tech stack (optional, AI can infer).
*   Select which artifacts to generate:
    *   Project-specific Cursor rules (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`)
    *   Technical specifications (PRD, TPS, UI/UX, Tech, Data, Integration - `docs/*.md`)
    *   Task checklist (`checklist.md`)
*   Generates content using AI (configurable provider via API key/endpoint).
*   Exports the complete starter kit as a `.zip` archive.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn
*   An API Key from your chosen AI provider (OpenAI, Google AI, or Anthropic).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd caps
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project. Add the API key for the provider you want to use.

You can optionally specify the provider and model names.

```ini
# --- Provider Selection (Optional) ---
# Explicitly set the provider ('openai', 'google', 'anthropic').
# If not set, the app will try to detect the provider based on which API key is present
# (checking for ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, then GOOGLE_API_KEY, then OPENAI_API_KEY).
# AI_PROVIDER=openai

# --- API Keys (Add the key for your chosen provider) ---
OPENAI_API_KEY=
GOOGLE_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=

# --- Model Names (Optional - Defaults are usually suitable) ---
# OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4-turbo
# GEMINI_MODEL_NAME=gemini-1.5-pro-latest
# CLAUDE_MODEL_NAME=claude-3-opus-20240229

# --- OpenAI Specific Base URL (Optional - For proxies or compatible APIs) ---
# OPENAI_API_BASE=
```

**Important:** You only need to provide the API key for the *one* provider you intend to use. The `.env.local` file is listed in `.gitignore` and should **never** be committed to version control.
