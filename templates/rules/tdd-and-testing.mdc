Employ Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles where practical.

- Write unit tests for core logic, helper functions, and individual components.
- Aim for good test coverage to ensure reliability.
- Include integration tests for critical user workflows and interactions between components or services.
- Ensure tests are maintainable and run automatically in CI/CD pipelines.
- Use descriptive test names that clearly state the intent and expected outcome.
