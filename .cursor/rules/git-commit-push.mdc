Ensure all changes are committed and pushed to GitHub after approval.

Workflow:
1. Run `git add <updated-files-and-directories> ...`
2. Commit changes using `git commit -m '<structured commit message>'`
3. Push changes using `git push origin <branch>`

Rules:
- No uncommitted changes should remain before switching tasks.
- Ensure meaningful and structured commit messages.
- Keep commits atomicâ€”one logical change per commit.
- Push changes regularly to maintain a clean Git history.
