Ensure all functions and classes have professional, meaningful docstrings and comments.

Python:
- Use Google-style docstrings for functions and classes.
- Avoid redundant comments that state the obvious.
- Keep comments updated alongside code changes.
- Explain the *why* behind complex logic.

TypeScript:
- Use JSDoc for all public functions, methods, and classes.
- Include parameter types and return types in documentation.
- Describe function behavior, expected inputs, and outputs.
- Keep inline comments minimal and meaningful.
